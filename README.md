# Todo App

[Live demo](https://todo-app-rcdvgn.vercel.app/)

This was the first React app I made. 

The whole project took me around 3 days in total to design and build, and it covers [fundamental React concepts](https://reactnative.dev/docs/intro-react) such as:
- Function components.
- State management.
- DOM manipulation.
- Side effects and more.

## Features

- Collaborative to-do list.
- `Add`, `Delete`, `Rename`, and `Filter` to-do items.
- Responsive layout.

## Limitations

- No data percistency between sessions.
- Inability to add or remove users.

Enjoy! ðŸ˜Š
